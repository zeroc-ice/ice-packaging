Ice - Comprehensive RPC Framework
======================================================================

Ice helps you network your software with minimal effort. By taking care
of all interactions with low-level network programming interfaces, Ice
allows you to focus your efforts on your application logic. When using
Ice, there is no need to worry about details such as opening network
connections, serializing and deserializing data for network transmission,
or retrying failed connection attempts (to name just a few of dozens of
such low-level details).

Feature highlights:

- Efficient, high-performance binary protocol
- Supports a wide range of programming languages and platforms
- Easy to use and type-safe API, with your own interfaces and types
  defined in a programming language neutral IDL, Slice
- Supports secure, encrypted communications by taking advantage of
  your platform's native SSL/TLS stack
- Familiar object-oriented programming model, with the ability to
  transmit proxies (references to remote objects) to remote applications
- Supports synchronous and asynchronous calls, for both client-side
  invocations and server-side dispatches
- Automatic discovery of remote objects through UDP multicast
- Comes with a number of optional services:
   - IceGrid, a DNS-like service for Ice objects, with support for server
     deployment, replication, monitoring, load-balancing and more
   - IceStorm, a lightweight topic-based pub-sub service
   - Glacier2, a sysadmin-friendly solution for routing Ice
     communications through firewalls
   - IcePatch2, an efficient software distribution and patching service
